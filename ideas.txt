Since an IMAP connection maintains a selected folder,
a background operation on an IMAP folder should be preemptible and,
if preempted, should automatically re-select the folder it was working on.

	async with self.backend.preemptible_folder_access('INBOX') as folder:
		message_ids = await folder.search()
		data = await folder.fetch(message_ids, params)

Can possibly be implemented in ImapBackend._command_queue,
with automatically issuing SELECT when the command folder does not match
the connection's currently selected folder.
